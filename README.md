ButterSeal
==========

This game has very little to do with its title. `:)`
----------------------------------------------------

A Game Development Project! With music! And a seal!

todo: more description?
      I don't have much to say about the game.
      Perhaps a more knowledgeable person (cough-@butterseal-cough) may chime in.

Butterseal is the name of the puzzle-based RPG herein.
The basic idea is literally saving the world through music.
Music brings warmth, and this is what thaws a silent, frozen world.
Throughout the game, you acquire certain spring-related powers (to combat the theme of winter).
These powers help you through subsequent levels,
  and culminate in the final boss level against a *secret imposter*.

Oh, and puns.

Lots of puns.
