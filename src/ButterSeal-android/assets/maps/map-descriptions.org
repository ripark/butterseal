#+Description: This document describes the design of each map used in the game as well as their logical structure in respect to the tiles they use.

* Ice Cave
** Goal
The goal of the ice cave is to get into the little spot that is directly in front of you, but is walled off.
You can see it because of the torches, but you must use the beacons to light a path for yourself.
(This means beacons are active; interacting with them lights its row and column.)
You've got to find a full path to the next instrument to continue the game.

** Tile Key
- =t= :: torch; you can walk through these and they light all the tiles around them (eight in all)
- =S= :: starting position
- =d= :: door to the ice cave
- =B= :: beacons; you can turn these around to light up different paths
- =#= :: walls
- =+= :: suggested path
- =$= :: MONEY.  (The goal; this would be some sort of instrument.)

All blank tiles are as yet unused.
