* Ice Cave
** Goal
The goal of the ice cave is to get into the little spot that is
directly in front of you, but is walled off.  You can see it because
of the torches, but you must use the beacons (you light them on fire
and direct them) to light a path for yourself.  You've got to find a
full path to the next instrument to continue the game.
** Tile descriptions
- =t= :: torch; you can walk through these and they light all the
         tiles around them (eight in all)

- =B= :: beacons; you can turn these around to light up different paths
- =#= :: walls
- =+= :: suggested path
- =$= :: MONEY.  (The goal; this would be some sort of instrument.)

All blank tiles are as yet unused.
