At the core of the new design is a state object that is shared between the multiple helper objects in the system.
This separation of state and function enables coherency throughout the entire system,
  a coherency that was not possible in the first design.
While every piece of software is what we call a state machine (including the first design),
  the realization and exploitation of this fundamental nature of the system empowers the designers
  to more fully understand and more effectively implement the functional requirements of the system.

But what is a state machine? Defined by Wikipedia's article:
<blockquote>
A finite-state machine (FSM) or finite-state automaton (plural: automata), or simply a <b>state machine</b>,
  is a mathematical model of computation used to design both computer programs and sequential logic circuits.
It is conceived as an abstract machine that can be in one of a finite number of states.
The machine is in only one state at a time; the state it is in at any given time is called the current state.
It can change from one state to another when initiated by a triggering event or condition; this is called a transition.
A particular FSM is defined by a list of its states, and the triggering condition for each transition.
</blockquote>
In simpler words, a state machine is a conceptual device composed of distinct states and transitions between those states.
As an example, consider an ATM: simplified, it has quite a few states:
<dl>
<dt>logged out</dt>
<dd>Nobody is using this ATM</dd>
<dt>logged in</dt>
<dd>Someone has logged in</dd>
<dt>card-check</dt>
<dd>Somebody has put in their card</dd>
<dt>transaction in place</dt>
<dd>The user has requested a transaction</dd>
</dl>
These are all potential states the ATM can be in, but it can only be in one at a time.
It is the interaction with the ATM that constitutes the transitions between these states:
<ul>
<li>When logged out, enter card-check upon a user putting in their card</li>
<li>When in card-check, enter logged-in upon credential confirmation</li>
<li>Upon appropriate input, enter transaction in place as appropriate</li>
<li>When logged in, enter logged out upon appropriate input</li>
</ul>
Additionally, each of these states causes the ATM to exhibit certain behaviors:
<dl>
<dt>logged out</dt>
<dd>display advertisements</dd>
<dt>logged in</dt>
<dd>display possible transactions</dd>
<dt>card-check</dt>
<dd>display progress bar</dd>
<dt>transaction in place</dt>
<dd>display progress bar</dd>
</dl>
State machines are all around youâ€”you need only look around.

Our game is now <em>very</em> similar.
While every piece of software is a state machine in the end,
  coherent pieces of software usually have some sort of state the the explicitly keep in some custom data structure.
We now have <a href="https://github.com/vermiculus/butterseal/blob/refactor/src/butterseal/src/edu/smcm/gamedev/butterseal/BSGameState.java">exactly this</a>;
  our implementation keeps track of many different states of the game
  (while DFAs are one-state only, equivalent NFAs allow multiple concurrent states),
  such as which way the player is facing, what power they've selected,
  what map their on in the world,
  their current position on the map, etc.
By sharing this state object between the interface and the player,
  we can keep consistency in the design and keep the code clear.
