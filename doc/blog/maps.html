<dl>
<dt>House</dt>
<dd>
  Just a normal house with snow and stuff.
  Entrance to the ice cave up to the north.
</dd>
<dt>Ice Cave</dt>
<dd>
  You enter it for the first time transitioning from the house.
  It is completely dark except for those cells lit by torches.
  The idea of the game is to light the beacons to light your path and remove the darkness, revealing walkable areas.
  You progress to the center of the map, where you collect the instrument and receive the 'light' power.
  You use your new power and light the rest of the cave, revealing an exit.
  The exit leads only to another part of the cave.
  The cave is layed out as a maze.
  You must make your way through the maze to the center, where 'growth' is waiting for you.
  With growth, you grow the seeds that are in the center of the maze and grow your way up and out of the ice cave.
</dd>
<dt>Forest</dt>
<dd>
  The forest is a map of ropes and changing lines.
  You send the lines and walk across them, so it's kindof like a maze that is always changing.
  You make your way to the center that has a rope ladder going down.
