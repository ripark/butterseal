<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
  We've had a lot of great art-based blog posts and even post or two on the story behind the game,
    but I think it's high time we put forth a more technical review of the source of the game.
  (It is my desire to have these code reviews on a weekly basis from here forward.)
</p>
<p>
  The code's source has gone through quite a few changes recently.
  Kyle has been able to get us walking along hereto,
    but working with new technologies <em>always</em> brings with it knowledge through mistakes.
  This occurance is natural and is often to be expected &emdash;
    especially when starting work outside of the context of good software engineering principles.
  The work was started out of necessity and has gotten us this far.
  Regardless, it is high time to <em>re</em>work the source.
