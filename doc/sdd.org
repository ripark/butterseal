#+Description: This document details the design of the game internals drawing from the description of the game itself.

* Functional Requirements
** User Interface
The game has an interface consisting of
- a directional pad
- an action button
- a way to choose a power
- a way to use the chosen power

A simplistic design would be as follows:

:   .                                                   .
:   .                                                   .
:   |                                                   |
:   | +---------+     ...     +------+---------+------+ |
:   | |         |             |      |         |      | |
:   | |    D    |     ...     | <--- | Current | ---> | |
:   | |   Pad   |     ...     | <--- |  Power  | ---> | |
:   | |         |             |      |         |      | |
:   | +---------+     ...     +------+---------+------+ |
:   +---------------------------------------------------+
